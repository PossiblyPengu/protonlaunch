"""Game stores other than Steam: Epic Games, GOG, Amazon, Battle.net, EA, Ubisoft, Rockstar, itch.io.

Two ways in, both ending with the store's app in the Steam library:
- Heroic (Epic Games, GOG and Amazon) and itch are Linux apps. They come from Flathub and are added
  to Steam the way home streaming apps are (streaming.set_up): an App with kind "store".
- The other stores only have a Windows app. Deckhand downloads the store's own installer from its
  official address and installs it like any setup file (core.Installer, under the store's name):
  its own prefix, its own Steam shortcut, listed and uninstalled under Installed programs. The
  store's games are then installed and played from inside it.
